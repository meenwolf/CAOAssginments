# CAO Assginments
Here is an initial read me file. First make sure that you installed the packages mentioned in the OS Introduction assignment, and gcc. Update/upgrade them all. You have to clone this repostery (I did it starting from the normal(windows) VSCode). Then you can open a linux based terminal, navigate using $cd repoPath$ to the repostery path. Then with $code .$  you can open VSCode. Now VSCode knows you want a linux based version of VSCode which you might need to download in VSCode as well. Then before you can run a C file, you need to install extentions:  C/C++, C/C++ Extention Pack and Code Runner. Also, in a linux based version of VSCode you might have to change settings:
- go to settings and search for: code run in terminal, and check the box
- in the terminal field, click on the arrow downwards next to the + sign, click select default profile and choose a linux based one.

Then you close VSCode, and open it again via a linux terminal. In the terminal field(if no shows run the c program) and configure git username and email.
configure as follows:
- git config user.name "Marleen Siebons"
- git config user.email "m.s.j.siebons@student.utwente.nl"
- check for no mistakes with cat .git/config

And you can pull, commit and push :)
